    "content": "It's been 2 weeks when my mom and I tried to find it! We checked in eBird and facebook for its records, we went to different parks for its presence, but all failed. Today, in our backyard, when I looked up the sky, I saw a bird with a long tail flying by. It's it! The Scissor-tailed Flycatcher. We rushed out with camera, running to our neighbor's house, where there's a tree it rested on. And I'm lucky enough to take a beautiful photo of it.\nI feel so excited this time, the bird we spent long time to find, is in our backyard!",

    "content": "One day, my mom and I spotted an interesting insect on the stem of a plant. When we approached it, it teleported to avoid us. When we turned left, it instantly moved to the right side of the stem, and when we turned right, it moved to the left. It moved so fast that we couldn't tell if it was hopping or crawling. How did it detect and even predict our movements? Was it the light and shadows it saw with its eyes, or the sounds it heard with its ears, or some uncanny sixth sense?",
