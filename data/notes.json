    "content": "The sky is filled with birds, poopping out like raindrops falling on everyone. But can you imagine? Soon, these tiny creatures will travel more than 10,000 miles all the way to Brazil. Why not just stop in Mexico, where the weather is also warm?\nI looked it up, and the answer amazed me ? they don?t stay in Mexico because they want to avoid competition. Brazil offers them more food, more space, and greater safety.\nI look up at the sky again, and suddenly, I feel a deep sympathy for them.",

    "content": "Look! A whole flock of Black Vultures is gathered by the roadside, tearing at a dead animal. Their wings flap and their calls echo as they fight over every piece. It's a bit horrifying to watch ? they show no hesitation, no mercy, just hunger. Be careful, if you drive too fast, you might run over some of them. That will be their LAST SUPPER.",

    "content": "Today, when I was cleaning the pictures, I noticed something interesting. This Easten Phoebe is sitting by a dried lizard, is it the snack of the Phoebe? But I know the phoebes eat insects, and their beaks are too weak to catch lizards. Then whoes snack is it?\n\nI shared this finding with my mom, and we both came up with the same guess -- Shrike, the famouse butcher bird!",

    "content": "It's been 2 weeks when my mom and I tried to find it! We checked in eBird and facebook for its records, we went to different parks for its presence, but all failed. Today, in our backyard, when I looked up the sky, I saw a bird with a long tail flying by. It's it! The Scissor-tailed Flycatcher. We rushed out with camera, running to our neighbor's house, where there's a tree it rested on. And I'm lucky enough to take a beautiful photo of it.\nI feel so excited this time, the bird we spent long time to find, is in our backyard!",

    "content": "One day, my mom and I spotted an interesting insect on the stem of a plant. When we approached it, it teleported to avoid us. When we turned left, it instantly moved to the right side of the stem, and when we turned right, it moved to the left. It moved so fast that we couldn't tell if it was hopping or crawling. How did it detect and even predict our movements? Was it the light and shadows it saw with its eyes, or the sounds it heard with its ears, or some uncanny sixth sense?",
